# UDPSockets

### Introduction
**UDPSockets** demonstrates a minimalistic UDP client/server architecture, written completely in Swift! Currently written for macOS, but most of the interesting code (`UDPClient` and `UDPServer`) should work the same on iOS.

### Disclaimers
* I'm an iOS developer by trade, so my macOS skills are rudimentary at best... apologies for the noobness.
* This is very much still a work in progress, but if you're interested in socket programming, keep an eye on this repo or submit pull requests!
